        <p>CryJaxx on tour in Guiyan, China(2019)
        As DJ-s, they played few small gigs in their hometown until they made their first big appearance at the biggest festival in Albania,
        Colour Day Festival, on the 18th of May, 2019. Later on they had their inaugural tour of China in September and October, 2019, where they played 9 different
        shows in 9 different major Chinese cities. Including cities like Shanghai, Changsha, Zhanjiang, Zhenjiang, Guiyang, Dalian, Hangzhou etc. and very
        prestigious clubs such as Play House, Dr. Oscar, REX, Space Club, Hardstar (official partner of Defqon.1) and few others. On December 20th, 2019
        CryJaxx performed in the first ever electronic dance music festival in Albania called "Rage of the Rampage" alongside of the Polish well known DJ and
        Producer, Blinderz.
        </p>
    
        <p>Mario and Serafin also have worked closely with award-winning investigative reporter, Ian Urbina, who writes most often for The New York Times,
        but is also a contributing writer for The Atlantic a regular contributor to National Geographic, and a member of the High Seas Initiative Leadership 
        Council at The Aspen Institute. Urbina is the author of The New York Times bestseller “The Outlaw Ocean” (2019) on which CryJaxx were involved in a new
        idea of making soundtracks for books. They released a 4 track EP titled “Le Voyage” on which they conveyed the emotions from this book into the art 
        of music.
        </p>
    
        <p>This is what they said about this project: “We are so honored to be part of this great cause and super happy we got to work with people that are making
        a change in the world. This is a little summery for our first ever EP which is very different from our usual style but very fitting for the project. With
        naming the EP and the tracks individually we wanted to tell a story. It's "Le Voyage" of a lifetime. The “Fluid Borders” in the ocean are dangerous and
        life threatening, but we want to portray that these borders in art are really fluid and we can move them for the good of the people.
        </p>
    
        <p>Then the opposite of the good people might be "Armed and Dangerous" people, so we wanted to make a catchy and dangerous melody to make the heart beat a
        bit faster. But, the ocean is an “Undiscovered Realm” and we just see the surface but what lies beneath it is a mystery to all of us. To close off all
        the album we really aimed to show that there is hope and that we have the “Sea Guardians” just like Ian and other people who really care about what is
        happening and are giving these issues a voice and a solution to make the world a better place, one wave at a time.”
    
        CryJaxx have announced that they are working with few well-known Albanian singers in remixing and making original productions for them. They have also
        announced that they are working on a lot of singles and numerous international collaborations with well-known artists form all around the world.</p>
